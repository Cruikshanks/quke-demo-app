# Quke demo app

A Sinatra web app packaged as a gem that is used to demonstrate https://github/DEFRA/quke

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'quke_demo_app'
```

And then execute:

```shell
bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```shell
gem install quke-demo-app
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bundle exec rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

> For those new to these commands it's literally just `bin/console` you enter and not `bundle exec bin/console` or `. bin/console`.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
